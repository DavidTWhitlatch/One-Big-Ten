## Further Description 
This website is designed for young, curious consumers who are also looking to invest in products they generally like and use most often. The goal is for a user to be able to search for a product and find out which conglomerate makes it and vice versa. By knowing the source of his/her products, user can then see a detailed description of the company's stock info and status. Based on that, user can make a more informed decision on whether to invest or not. We also allow users to add/delete/edit products to/from specific conglomerates. 

## Possibilities post-MVP
- Users with authentiction
-  Users can have their own profiles with list of favorite products/conglomerates
- Adding an admin to approve any submissions or edits before being posted
- Matching game for interactivity (users can have high scores)
- Personalized suggestions for inveting
